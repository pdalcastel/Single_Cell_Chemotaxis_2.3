# Single_Cell_Chemotaxis_2.3
This CompuCell3D model reproduces chemotaxis by polarization reorientation. With its internal field F-actin, the compartmentalized cell can spontaneously polarize and migrate in random persistent fashion. When sensing an external constant chemical gradient, the cell reorients its polarization, favoring migration in the gradient direction.
