1) Download the entire DISTRIBUTED folder. 

2) If you do not have CompuCell3D (CC3D) installed:
    1. Go to https://compucell3d.org/SrcBin and download the binary adequated to your operational system
    2. Follow the installation instructions
    3. Complete installation, try running twedit++.bat and compucell3d.bat  o verify that they open correctly. If not, message me (contact at the end).
    
3) Idealy, start openning twedit++.bat, click the large black arrow pointing up (open CC3D project) or go to "CC3D Project"->"Open CC3D Project..." or use command Ctrl+Shift+O.

4) Go to your project location and open the file with the ".cc3d" extension. The Player window will pop up with the simulation loaded.

5) By default, the simulation runs automatically. If not, click the play button. 

6) You can change the parameters by hand inside the SCellSign.py file, or you can implement a parameter scan using CC3D default parameter scan or by implementing a Python script.

7) If you want to see an intense chemotactic response, I suggest you to try the parameters delta=0.01 and mu=1000000.
